### Problem Statement

We will build an API (via HTTP) for a StackOverflow-like app.

We will build two primary features in StackOverflow:

Question creation, retrieval & deletion
Answer creation, retrieval & deletion



### Objective

* Designing & building APIs
* Using a backend framework (Axum)
* Designing SQL models
* Hands-on usage of Postgres
* Writing testable code
* Organizing code using modules
* Navigating and contributing to an existing code base




### CRUD & DAO

CRUD stands for actions of creation, read, update & deletion. DAO stands for data access object and is an interface in the application to perform these actions against the database.
